I. INTRODUCTION

Ensuring safe navigation for visually impaired individuals remains a significant challenge, impacting their independence and safety. Traditional tools like white canes rely on tactile feedback, which can be slow and impractical in dynamic environments. Guide dogs, though helpful, are costly and require extensive maintenance, making them inaccessible to many.

Advancements in artificial intelligence and wearable technology present a transformative opportunity to address these limitations. This project introduces a lightweight, affordable wearable device that combines YOLOv8 for real-time object detection with Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) for immediate audio feedback. The system empowers users with enhanced situational awareness, bridging the gap between traditional aids and modern assistive technology to provide a scalable and inclusive solution.

II. BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK

Traditional assistive tools like white canes and guide dogs provide basic support but are limited in dynamic or complex environments. White canes require physical contact with obstacles, and guide dogs are costly and inaccessible to many.

Early assistive technologies used proximity sensors to detect obstacles, offering simple feedback through vibrations or sounds. However, these lacked the ability to classify objects or provide contextual information. Advances in AI, particularly object detection models like YOLO, have enabled real-time applications in navigation and obstacle detection. YOLO's speed and accuracy make it ideal for assistive solutions, with applications in pedestrian detection and autonomous systems.

This project leverages YOLOv8 and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) to provide real-time object detection and audio feedback, enhancing situational awareness for visually impaired users. By combining cutting-edge technology with affordability, the system bridges the gap between traditional aids and modern assistive devices, offering a scalable and practical solution.

The block diagram illustrates the core functionality of the smart AI-assisted spectacles. Upon initialization and hardware check, the system captures real-time visual data from the user's perspective. This raw image data undergoes preprocessing steps to enhance clarity and facilitate object detection. Subsequently, AI algorithms analyze the processed images to identify and locate relevant objects in the user's surroundings. The system then estimates the distance to these objects, integrating this information with other relevant data. Finally, the system provides real-time feedback to the user through voice guidance, alerting them to the presence, location, and distance of objects in their environment. This continuous feedback loop enables visually impaired individuals to navigate their surroundings with greater independence and confidence.

In high-density environments, such as crowded areas or busy streets, the device may experience occasional delays in processing and feedback. While the response time is generally fast, these delays can affect the system‚Äôs real-time effectiveness and may need refinement to ensure a consistently smooth user experience in complex scenarios.

C. Battery Life

The power-intensive nature of the processing required for real-time object detection can drain the device's battery quickly. This may limit the duration for which the device can be used continuously, requiring further optimization to balance performance and energy consumption for longer-lasting usability.
